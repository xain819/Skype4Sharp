> yung trump has permission to skid aids code to c#

- [SpongyBacon] (https://github.com/sponges) Helped with any issues I was having (a.k.a. "moral support")
- [Knackrack615] (http://knackrack615.me/) Helped with basic logic in the library

# Dependencies
- [Json.NET] (http://www.newtonsoft.com/json)

# Usage
Look at the example bot for a working template, but if you really need full documentation, I'll provide it below.
The example is in C# Console, but it should be easy enough to adapt.

Logging in
```C#
static Skype4Sharp.Skype4Sharp mainSkype;
static SkypeCredentials authCreds = new SkypeCredentials("USERNAME", "PASSWORD");
static void Main(string[] args)
{
  mainSkype = new Skype4Sharp.Skype4Sharp(authCreds);
  mainSkype.Login();
}
```
Setting events
```C#
mainSkype.messageReceived += MainSkype_messageReceived;
mainSkype.contactRequestReceived += MainSkype_contactRequestReceived;
// Do the rest of the events yourself, these are the two most important ones in my opinion
mainSkype.StartPoll();
```
Accepting a contact
```C#
private static void MainSkype_contactRequestReceived(ContactRequest sentRequest)
{
  sentRequest.Accept();
}
```
Declining a contact
```C#
private static void MainSkype_contactRequestReceived(ContactRequest sentRequest)
{
  sentRequest.Decline();
}
```
Sending a group message, editing it and more
```C#
private static void MainSkype_messageReceived(ChatMessage pMessage)
{
  ChatMessage rMessage = pMessage.Chat.SendMessage("Processing your message...");
  rMessage.Body = "Second message";
  rMessage.Type = MessageType.RichText;
  rMessage.Body = "<b>THIS IS BOLD</b>";
}
```
Messaging a user
```C#
ChatMessage rMessage = mainSkype.SendMessage("c0mmodity", "Hello me!");
```
Adding or removing a user
```C#
mainSkype.AddUser("c0mmodity", "I'd like to add you on Skype!");
mainSkype.RemoveUser("c0mmodity");
```
Interacting with a chat (put in context, so it's easier for me to explain)
```C#
private static void MainSkype_messageReceived(ChatMessage pMessage)
{
  Chat newChat = pMessage.Chat;
  Console.WriteLine("The chat's topic is {0}", newChat.Topic);
  newChat.Topic = "Skype4Sharp";
  Console.WriteLine("My role in this chat is '{0}'", newChat.Role.ToString());
  newChat.Add("c0mmodity");
  newChat.SetAdmin("c0mmodity");
  Console.WriteLine("c0mmodity is a(n) {0}", newChat.UserRole("c0mmodity").ToString());
  newChat.Kick("eroded");
  newChat.Leave();
}
```
Logging a call
```C#
private void MainSkype_callStarted(Chat originChat, User eventInitiator)
{
  Console.WriteLine("[EVENT]: CALL_STARTED > {0} ({1})", originChat.ID, eventInitiator.Username);
}
```

# FAQ
(Not actually questions I've been asked, just what I'd assume would be asked.)
---
Q : Why didn't you sell this?

A : It's not my code to sell. Also, as Skype4COM is bad enough as it is, you C# devs deserve options.

---
Q : This isn't working! I need help.

A : No. I don't offer formal support. If you really are stuck, message me on Skype (found in the Contacts section).

---
Q : I have a new feature I'd like for you to add.

A : Sure! Please raise it as an issue and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

---
Q : Can I sell this code?

A : No. Read LICENSE.md if you want a more detailed answer, but you cannot sell my code as is, without any obvious modifications.

---
Q : *feature* is broken, what can I do?

A : Raise it as an issue, and I'll sort it out when I can. Please understand that I'm not paid for this, and I do have real world commitments.

---
Q : Wow! This is amazing, how can I help? (yeah, no-one's actually said this, but it'd be nice, y'know?)

A : You can donate to me via Bitcoin (1EugenekHHxybWkaeb566mnUKtpfEiyPSu), or just send me a nice message :smile:
